Thank you to our volunteers. These extraordinary students volunteered their
time on a Tuesday to sort through trash and recyclables -- a task that demonstrates
an unrelenting dedication to improving waste infrastructure on campus and true grit.
Not only did we accomplish something on April 12, but this group of students was
able to enjoy themselves and make light of a very dirty day. Thank you Duke Students
for your interest in our project and results.
